# PyBox #

PyBox (short for "Python Sandbox") is a flexible and light-weight process and system analysis framework.

Originally, we started this project with the intention to create a sandbox toolkit for semi-automated malware analysis, which is both easy to understand and extend. Using Python as main programming language allows dynamic and even runtime modifications to the scripts containing monitoring settings and functionality. This removes the need for frequent re-compilation of source code when tailoring the application to special cases and benefits the idea of rapid prototyping.

The original idea of PyBox is described in

[PyBox - A Python approach to sandboxing. Felix Leder and Daniel Plohmann, 2010.](https://eldorado.tu-dortmund.de/bitstream/2003/27336/1/BookOfAbstracts_Spring5_2010.pdf)
