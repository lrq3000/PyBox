# Introduction #

This is the home of PyBox, a user-level framework for monitoring processes.
PyBox consists of
  * a module (PyBox.dll), which is being injected into a target process and
  * an API providing various tools for logging and analysis of activity as well as full manipulation of processes.

This rootkit-like approach allows close monitoring of behavior, thus helping to understand functionality of programs.
